# Dungeon-Escape
### 2D Mobile Action Game

Dungeon escape is a simple Dungeon Attack and Defense game built using the Unity 3D game engine.
By building the game, I intended to gain more experience in using the game engine in developing testing environments for autonomous devices in a virtual world. 

However, through this project, I got an appreciation of game development and the different skills that are required in the game development pipeline.

##### This project features:
  - Multiple level designs
  - Industry grade graphic design
  - Unity ads
  - Scene transitions and level management
